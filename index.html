5. Click **Commit changes**

---

### Step 3 — Delete the entire `src/` folder
Since we no longer need `src/main.jsx` or `src/rocketline-express.jsx`, delete them:
1. Click into `src/` folder
2. Click `main.jsx` → **⋯ menu → Delete file → Commit**
3. If `rocketline-express.jsx` is still there → delete it too

---

### Step 4 — Watch Vercel
It will auto-redeploy. You should get a green ✅ **Ready** in about 20 seconds.

Your repo root will look like this when done:
```
rocketline-express/
├── index.html      ← updated (points to index.jsx)
├── index.jsx       ← NEW (the entire app, self-contained)
├── package.json    ← unchanged
└── vite.config.js  ← unchanged
